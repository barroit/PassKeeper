Table Schema
============

sqltime
-------
The calendar time at the record creation. This column stores time in
UTC.

modtime
-------
The calendar time at the last record modification, this column stores
time in UTC.

Note
----
 - Store calendar time in UTC is for consistency. To display the calendar
   time to end users in their local time zone, the column value should be
   adjusted by adding the standard time zone offset (e.g., UTC+9 for Japan)
   and an additional daylight saving time offset where applicable.
