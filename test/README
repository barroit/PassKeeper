Naming Tests
------------

The test files are named as:

	tNNNN-name-details.t

where N is a decimal digit.

First digit tells the family:

	0 - reserved
	1 - basic functions and executing flows
	2 - main command and its options
	3 - other main commands for this program (e.g. pk-init)
	4 - commands for CLI
	5 - other commands that may not related to the project purpose

Second digit tells the particular command we are testing.

Third digit (optionally) tells the particular switch or group of switches
we are testing.

Test generated files
--------------------

Always prefix the generated files. Identical file names (e.g. tmp/db) will
definitely create conflicts.
